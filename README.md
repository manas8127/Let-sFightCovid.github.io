I made this web page on Covid Awareness from scratch using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The webpage is mobile optimized. The sketches in the prcautions section is made by my father and all the other image resources belong to their respective owners. I am in no way claiming any copyright on the images that I have used in making this website. I have hosted it using GitHub pages.
